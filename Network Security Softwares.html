              If you want the best graphic design software for vector drawing
              and editing, then really you'll want Adobe Illustrator. Regular
              updates have kept it ahead of growing competition in terms of the
              range of features and tools (including the addition of Firefly
              AI), and it also remains the industry-standard software, meaning
              that if you're working or anyone other than yourself, you'll
              probably be expected to use it for vector design work. Illustrator
              allows you to create everything from illustrations to logos with a
              lot of creative freedom. It also has a lot of useful features and
              shortcuts to help speed up your workflow. The learning curve is
              fairly steep initially, but we think that once you know your way
              around the program, it offers a pleasant interface to use. We've
              also been pleased with some of the latest updates Adobe has made
              to allow customisation of the toolbar. It's also added Rotate View
              and a Width Tool that makes it simple to add variations to vector
              lines. There's also a new The only downside we can see really is
              that Illustrator is part of Adobe Creative Cloud, which means that
              it's only available via a monthly subscription, either for
              Illustrator alone or to Adobe's full suite of creative apps, which
              includes Photoshop, InDesign and more. This has its advantages in
              that you automatically get all the latest updates to the software
              but it also makes Illustrator quite a lot more expensive than
              comparable programs in the long term.
            </p>
            <p>
              Illustrator is included with Adobe Creative Cloud subscriptions
              but can also be licensed independently. Because it is part of the
              Creative Cloud artwork from Illustrator can be shared with other
              Adobe Creative Cloud applications including After Effects,
              InDesign, Photoshop and Premiere Pro. For example, users often
              create an initial piece of artwork in Illustrator and then import
              the artwork into Photoshop or After Effects. Illustrator user can
              also create an image and export it to InDesign to include it
              within a book or magazine. Users also export an Illustrator image
              to After Effects to create an animation of the image. Similarly,
              artwork can be imported from Photoshop into Illustrator, where a
              final design can be assembled, mixing text, illustrations, and the
              imported image.

              Once the market leader in vector design, CorelDRAW lost some of
              its popularity to Adobe Illustrator, but it still has legions of
              loyal fans and it continues to upgrade its offering to keep up
              with most of the features offered by competitors. It's now
              available in two formats: in CorelDRAW Standard, which is marketed
              to amateur enthusiasts, and CorelDRAW Graphics Suite, which is a
              larger package of tools aimed at professional designers. Just to
              make things more confusing, the latter itself comes in two
              versions, with CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2021 available for a
              one-off payment but the new 2022 version requiring a subscription.
              The subscription model gives you access to the latest features,
              which include dynamic asset management and a faster adjustments
              docker for photo editing. It takes a while to get your head around
              the different options, but we reckon CorelDRAW is now actually the
              most flexible graphic design software, since you can choose
              between buying the software outright or subscribing for access to
              newer features. It also now has an iPad app and a browser-based
              app as well as the Windows and Mac desktop software, giving you
              more flexibility in how you work. CorelDRAW Standard and CorelDRAW
              Graphics Suite 2021 have fairly steep upfront costs, with list
              prices at $299 and $549 respectively, but the CorelDRAW Graphics
              Suite 2022 costs around $22 per month, including the pixel-based
              CorelPHOTO-PAINT and a RAW image editor for a similar price to an
              Adobe single-app subscription. The package includes a lot of the
              same capabilities as Adobe Illustrator and Affinity Serif, and
              fans of CorelDRAW insist that its interface is easier to use. We
              think a lot of that comes down to preference and what you're
              familiar with, however, and we'd recommend taking out the free
              trial to see how you find it. If you do opt for Corel, the good
              news is that there's no issue with importing and exporting AI, PSD
              and PDF files.

              Like most creative software programs, CorelDraw is in competition
              with the market leader Adobe – in this case, Adobe Illustrator.
              While Illustrator is considered the professional standard in
              graphics software, CorelDraw has carved out a niche in the market
              with its lower price, reduced difficulty and features suited to
              industrial applications.

              Adobe Photoshop is useful for photo editing, graphic design, photo
              restoration/retouching, photo-realistic drawings, and matte
              paintings. Nowadays, Adobe Photoshop is used to edit photos on
              mobile devices as well. Adobe Photoshop has many benefits,
              including an easy user interface, quick photo rendering time, and
              powerful tools like Content-Aware Fill and Adobe Camera Shake
              Reduction. Adobe Photoshop has an Adobe Exchange panel. The Adobe
              community is where users can get help with how-to videos,
              tutorials on using tools in Adobe Photoshop or even download free
              templates for Adobe InDesign or Illustrator.Adobe Photoshop works
              by using Adobe Bridge, Adobe Camera Raw, and Adobe Mini Bridge.
              Adobe Bridge is used to view images on your computer or connected
              devices like USB flash drives. Adobe Camera Raw allows you to open
              RAW file formats from your camera that other photo editing
              software applications do not support. . You could also start
              tweaking your photos with light photo editing such as editing the
              brightness, saturation, or contrast. Adobe Mini Bridge helps the
              user make edits in a larger preview mode without having Adobe
              Photoshop open. Adobe Mini Bridge also allows the user to add
              Adobe Photoshop effects and layers while working in Adobe
              Illustrator or Adobe InDesign.

              Adobe Photoshop plugins are software programs that can extend the
              capabilities of Photoshop like content-aware fill, smart sharpen,
              or liquify. These plugins are add-on utilities that allow the user
              to extend or modify Adobe Photoshop. Many plugin options are
              available, like Alien Skin Eye Candy, and Topaz Labs also offers
              several different plug-ins, including PhotoFXlab, Detail Pro,
              Re.When choosing Adobe Photoshop, you have to decide if you need
              photo editing software or photo manipulation software. If photo
              editing is what you are interested in, then the standard version
              of Adobe Photoshop would meet your needs. Still, if photo
              manipulation is more important than photo creation/editing
              capabilities, then the Creative Cloud subscription might be better
              for the features included.
