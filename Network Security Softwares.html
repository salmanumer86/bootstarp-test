              NordVPN is one of the best VPNs available today. The slew of
              privacy options and servers remains a huge draw as does its
              ability to get around geo-locked content on Netflix, Hulu, and
              more. Additionally, NordVPN remains a top choice for those seeking
              a VPN that works in China. The main drawbacks continue to be the
              premium price and somewhat inconsistent speeds. But, NordVPN
              remains a top contender for best VPN in 2022... at a premium
              price. If you’re using the internet, you’re doing so through an
              Internet Service Provider (ISP). That ISP is also recording
              everything you’re doing in some capacity. While the data isn’t
              easily accessible or being used actively (to, say, serve you ads),
              you don't have a say in what does or doesn’t get logged. A VPN,
              however, obscures your browsing habits and routes your IP address
              through a server the VPN company provides instead of your ISP’s
              server. NordVPN takes a no-frills approach to VPNs. Monthly

              The Android app features a blue and white map, some trees, a few
              boats, and map markers to identify VPN locations. A simple
              drop-down menu reveals your new IP address and your current
              location. Over in settings, you can add more layers of security.
              The CyberSec option blocks ads and protects your phone or laptop
              from malware and phishing attacks. You can auto connect using
              Quick Connect, the default option, or choose your preferred server
              or country. The app is easy enough to navigate, but there's a
              slight learning curve to the various offerings. You can't easily
              figure out if tapping on, say, "Obfuscated Servers" or "Auto
              Connect Server" will turn something on or take you to a new page
              with additional information. NordVPN works seamlessly across all
              the devices we tested. The Android app is lightweight with minimal
              battery usage, even when working in the background. Over on Chrome
              as a proxy, it works as you would expect. Just click on the
              drop-down menu, select your server, and start using a VPN. There
              are nearly 6000 servers in 59 countries, so there’s definitely an
              option out there for you. NordVPN looks great on a Mac. It’s still
              minimalist, but all the features are easily accessible through the
              menu pane that drops down. You can search for features or quickly
              toggle on security features or see what VPNs are available.

              Maybe the biggest name in antivirus and protection software,
              Norton Security gets a lot right, though for some reason just has
              to install an annoying toolbar and browser extension. Check out
              our full Norton Security review to know more about its pros and
              cons. Compared to many software companies, Norton LifeLock
              (formerly part of Symantec) has been around a long time. With the
              2019 rebranding of Norton Security, its main product, to Norton
              360, we chose to have a look into what has changed. Read this full
              Norton Security review to see how it holds up against modern
              antiviruses. Norton offers almost all of the features and options
              you could want from an antivirus. However, this makes some of the
              menus complicated. You will often have to go through multiple tabs
              and windows to change a setting. If you’re willing to go through
              hoops to find them, though, most features can be tweaked or turned
              off. There were a couple of features that were missing, such as
              Norton not having a quick access button for its quarantine. You
              would usually find this in a list that is accessible from an
              antivirus’ main page, like you do with Malwarebytes Antivirus. A
              dedicated settings window does exist, which you can use to access
              most settings for a variety of features. This includes a list of
              “quick controls,” which allow you to temporarily deactivate
              security features, such as Norton’s firewall.
            </p>
            <p>
              This firewall allows you to choose which networks and programs can
              have greater access, as well as whether it should block certain
              types of traffic. By default, the firewall provides great
              protections across the board, except with traffic types where
              security isn’t often needed. Norton also comes with a password
              manager. When you first open it, you will need to add a password,
              which you will have to use every time you enter the password
              manager. There are also settings to make individual passwords
              request it every time. This isn’t the best password manager
              available, but this is useful for keeping some personal
              information safe.
